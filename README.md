# Impact of macroeconomic variables on the exchange rates of BRICS nations 
A project done using R where different macroeconomic variables like inflation, balance of payments,GDP,intrest rates are considered to study its impact on the exchange rates of the BRICS nations for 10 years i.e from 2011-2021(quarterly).
The code starts with the explorartory data analysis of each country seperately and multi-linear regression has been built to know the p-value,dependency of the independent variables on the exchange rate which is determined by the R-squared and adjusted R-squared. 
For the country India, a time series model using ARIMA and the values have been predicted for the next two years i.e 2022-2023. 
A table can be made to compare the R and the adjusted R squared value of the countries to determine which country has an impact of all the variables on the exchange rates.
